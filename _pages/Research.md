Cities, situated at the crossroads of rising temperatures and growing populations, bear the brunt of climate change and must adapt to the *new normal* of extreme weather impacts. Among the most dangerous of these hazards is extreme heat, which continues to intensify in frequency, severity, and duration. Today, we face both a crucial responsibility and a unique opportunity to implement urban design interventions and adaptation strategies that will equip cities to withstand the impacts of climate change in the coming century. My research focuses on exploring innovative urban design and climate adaptation strategies to combat the growing threat of extreme heat ,floods and pollution especially in rapidly developing cities.


| **High-Resolution Modeling of Bologna’s Heatwaves** <br> <br>
 Bologna exhibits strong spatial variability in summer temperatures due to its historic core, compact mid-rise districts, and low-density peripheries. As heatwaves intensify in frequency and magnitude, understanding the city’s intra-urban thermal dynamics becomes essential. To address this, we are developing a high-resolution mesoscale modeling framework for Bologna to investigate heatwave behavior, spatial temperature contrasts, and urban boundary-layer processes. These insights will guide future climate-adaptation planning and heat-mitigation strategies.

| **Urban-Scale Rainfall and Flood Forecasting for Bangalore City** <br> <br> Reliable high-resolution rainfall forecasts are critical for enabling timely early warnings and informed decision-making, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions vulnerable to pluvial floods. This research presents a high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model developed for Bangalore City, India. The model is designed to provide probabilistic rainfall forecasts and is coupled with a two-dimensional hydrologic model to simulate flood inundation. To better capture the complex dynamics of urban rainfall, the WRF model integrates urban-specific datasets, including the World Urban Database Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT), Single-layer Urban Canopy Model (SUCM), and Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classifications. These enhancements significantly improve the accuracy of forecasts at neighborhood scales<br> <br> Read more: [[Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56091-w)] [[EarthArXiv Preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/gxj9m/)] | <img src="/assets/research/Heavy_rain.png" width="500px" alt="NSR"> |



| **Influence of heat waves on intra-urban heat islets** <br> <br> Heat waves are known further exacerbate the urban heat islands. I am currently working in collaboration with NOAA's Center for Earth System Sciences and Remote Sensing Technologies ([NOAA-CESSRST](https://www.noaacrest.org/)) to explore the impact of such heat waves on the dynamics of intra-urban heat islets and the role of complex urban morphology in this interaction. I am using a combination of remotely sensed observations as well as the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model to simulate the heat waves of 2018 experienced by three major megacities - Paris, Los Angeles, and New Delhi | <img src="/assets/images/Paris.png" width="1800px" alt="Paris"> |

**Resilience Analysis of Climate Proofing strategies of cities** <br> <br> Cities are at the forefront of climate change impacts and face a growing burden of adaptation to ensuing natural hazards. In response, the global network of [C-40 Cities](https://www.c40.org/) have adopted various strategies to “climate proof” themselves. Here, we use the Stability Landscape model of a *ball-in-a-bowl*, adapted from [Walker et. al. (2004)](https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5/inline.html), to investigate the [top 100 strategies](https://issuu.com/sustainia/docs/cities100) of 2015 from an Urban Resilience viewpoint. With this model, we are able to demonstrate the need and possible pathways for adaptation to climate extremes in a more comprehensive way. <br><br> Get in touch for further details: [[View Poster](/assets/files/C40_AMS-Poster.pdf)] [[Presentation](/assets/files/C40_report.pdf)] | <img src="/assets/images/C40-header.png" width="2400px" alt="C40"> |

| **Impact of spatial organization of Local Climate Zones on Urban Surface temperatures** <br> <br> [Local Climate Zones (LCZ)](http://www.wudapt.org/lcz/) are an urban land cover land use classification system that help standardize methods of observation and documentation in urban heat island studies. It is based on a random forest classification workflow implemented in SAGA GIS. I worked on developing LCZ maps for diverse cities across the world. While there is a point-to-point correlation between the LCZ classes and Urban Temperatures, the spatial neighborhoods of each LCZs strongly influence the temperature distributions as well. <br><br> Read more: [[Poster](/assets/files/LCZ_LST_AMS-poster.pdf)] [[BAMS Article](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-16-0236.1)] | <img src="/assets/images/LCZ.png" width="1600px" alt="LCZ"> |
